Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as [[Monk]] weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a [[short rest]] or [[long rest]], you can touch one weapon, focus your [[Ki]] on it, and then count that weapon as a [[Monk]] weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

-   The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.

-   You must be proficient with it.

-   It must lack the heavy and special properties.
