Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]], you can touch one weapon, focus your [[Ki]] on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

-   The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.

-   You must be proficient with it.

-   It must lack the heavy and special properties.

*Note: Optional addition from [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
