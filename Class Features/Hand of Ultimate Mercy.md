By 17th level, Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As an action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 [[Ki]] points. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: [[blinded]], [[deafened]], [[paralyzed]], [[poisoned]], and [[stunned]].

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Long Rest]].
