By 15th level, you have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:

-   You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are now immune to the poisoned condition.

-   You can cast [[Greater Restoration]] and [[Heal]] without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without providing the material component, provided you use alchemistâ€™s supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a [[Long Rest]].
