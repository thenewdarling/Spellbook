At 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can magically create a Tiny quill in your free hand. The magic quill has the following properties:

-   The quill doesnâ€™t require ink. When you write with it, it produces ink in a color of your choice on the writing surface.

-   The time you must spend to copy a spell into your spell book equals 2 minutes per spell level if you use the quill for the transcription.

-   You can erase anything you write with the quill if you wave the feather over the text as a bonus action, provided the text is within 5 feet of you.

This quill disappears if you create another one or if you die.
