In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain [[Warlock]] levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the [[Warlock]] table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to [[Warlock]] level, not character level.

# List of Invocations

While someone else is wearing your talisman, you can use your action to teleport to the unoccupied space closest to them, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence. The wearer of your talisman can do the same thing, using their action to teleport to you. The teleportation can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a [[long rest]].

## Book of Ancient Secrets

**_Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature_**  
You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list; these rituals needn’t be from the same spell list. The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a [[Warlock]] spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your [[Warlock]] level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

## Chains of Carceri

**_Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature_**  
You can cast [[Hold Monster]] at will – targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental – without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a [[long rest]] before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.

## Cloak of Flies

**_Prerequisite: 5th level_**  
As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you're [[incapacitated]] or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

You can cast the [[Sending]] spell, targeting a creature whose name is on the page, without using a spell slot and without using material components. To do so, you must write the message on the page. The target hears the message in their mind, and if the target replies, their message appears on the page, rather than in your mind. The writing disappears after 1 minute.

As an action, you can magically erase a name on the page by touching it.

## Fiendish Vigor

You can cast [[False Life]] on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are [[blinded]] and [[deafened]] to your own surroundings.

## Gift of the Protectors

**_Prerequisite: 9th level, Pact of the Tome feature_**  
A new page appears in your Book of Shadows. With your permission, a creature can use its action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your proficiency bonus.

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 hit point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a [[long rest]].
