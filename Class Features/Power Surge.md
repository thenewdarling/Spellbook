Starting at 6th level, you can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells.

You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a [[long rest]], your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with [[Dispel Magic]] or [[Counterspell]], you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a [[short rest]] with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a [[Wizard]] spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your [[Wizard]] level.
