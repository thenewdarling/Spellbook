At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it. When you cast a [[School of Enchantment]] spell to charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains unaware of being [[charmed]].

Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent [[charmed]]. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed the duration of your [[School of Enchantment]] spell.
