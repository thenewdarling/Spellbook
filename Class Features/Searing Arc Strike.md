At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your [[Ki]] into searing waves of energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 2 [[Ki]] points to cast the [[Burning Hands]] spell as a bonus action.

You can spend additional [[Ki]] points to cast [[Burning Hands]] as a higher level spell. Each additional [[Ki]] point you spend increases the spell's level by 1. The maximum number of [[Ki]] points (2 plus any additional points) that you can spend on the spell equals half your monk level.
