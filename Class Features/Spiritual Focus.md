At 3rd level, you employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes. You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your [[Bard]] spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck.

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a [[Bard]] spell that deals damage or restores hit points through the Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.
