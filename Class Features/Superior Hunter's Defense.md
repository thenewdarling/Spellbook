At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

-   **Evasion.** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on a saving throw, and only half damage if you fail

-   **Stand Against the Tide.** When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

-   **Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.
