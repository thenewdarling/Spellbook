At 6th level, you gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you. As a bonus action, you cast [[Command]], without expending a spell slot, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast [[Command]] as a bonus action on each of your turns, without expending a spell slot.

Any creature charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the [[Command]] you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a [[Long Rest]].
