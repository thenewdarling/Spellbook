Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your [[Sneak Attack]]; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your [[Sneak Attack]] against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for [[Sneak Attack]] still apply to you.
