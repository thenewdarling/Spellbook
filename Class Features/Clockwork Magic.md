You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Clockwork Spells table ([[Sorcerer Clockwork Soul Spells]]). Each spell counts as a [[Sorcerer]] spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of [[Sorcerer]] spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

Whenever you gain a [[Sorcerer]] level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be an abjuration or a transmutation spell from the [[Sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], or [[Wizard]] spell list.
