At 14th level, the magic of the Feywild grants you the ability to travel mentally or physically through dreamlands.

When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following spells, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components: [[Dream]] (with you as the messenger), [[Scrying]], or [[Teleportation Circle]].

This use of [[Teleportation Circle]] is special. Rather than opening a portal to a permanent teleportation circle, it opens a portal to the last location where you finished a long rest on your current plane of existence. If you haven't taken a long rest on your current plane, the spell fails but isn't wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
