Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a [[Long Rest]], roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a [[Long Rest]], you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
