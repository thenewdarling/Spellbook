At 3rd level, as you nudge someone closer to the grave, you can channel the power of death to harm someone else as well. Immediately after you deal your [[Sneak Attack]] damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of [[Sneak Attack]] dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the rollâ€™s total, as wails of the dead sound around them for a moment.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
