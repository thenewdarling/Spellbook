At 2nd level, You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your [[Druid]] spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.

While holding this map, you have these benefits:

-   You know the [[Guidance]] cantrip.

-   You have the [[Guiding Bolt]] spell prepared. It counts as a [[Druid]] spell for you, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can have prepared.

-   You can cast [[Guiding Bolt]] without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a [[short rest]] or [[long rest]], and it destroys the previous map.
