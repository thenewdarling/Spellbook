Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]] before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
