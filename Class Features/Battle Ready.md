When you reach 3rd level, your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:

-   You gain proficiency with martial weapons.

-   When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.
