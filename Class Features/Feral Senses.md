At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any [[invisible]] creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't [[blinded]] or [[deafened]].
