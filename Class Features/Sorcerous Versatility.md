When you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing the magic within you flowing in new ways:

-   Replace one of the options you chose for the Metamagic feature with a different Metamagic option available to you.

-   Replace one cantrip you learned from this class' spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the [[Sorcerer]] spell list.

*Note: this is an optional class feature unlocked by [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
