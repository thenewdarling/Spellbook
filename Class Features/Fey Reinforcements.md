At 11th level, the royal courts of the Feywild have blessed you with the assistance of fey beings: you know the spell [[Summon Fey]]. It doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know, and you can cast it without a material component. You can also cast it once without using a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn't require concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.
