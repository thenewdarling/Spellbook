Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn [[invisible]] and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain [[invisible]] until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]].
