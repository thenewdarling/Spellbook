At 11th level, your [[Gathered Swarm]] grows mightier in the following ways:

-   The damage of [[Gathered Swarm]] increases to 1d8.

-   If a creature fails its saving throw against being moved by the [[Gathered Swarm]], you can also cause the swarm to knock the creature [[prone]].

-   When you are moved by [[Gathered Swarm]], it gives you half cover until the start of your next turn.
