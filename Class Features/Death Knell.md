At 17th level, your association with death has become so close that you gain the following benefits:

-   When you use your Wails from the Grave, you can now deal the necrotic damage to both the first and the second creature.

-   At the end of a [[long rest]], a soul trinket appears in your hand if you don't have any soul trinkets, as the spirits of the dead are drawn to you.
