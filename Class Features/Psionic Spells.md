Starting at 1st level, you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Psionic Spells table ([[Sorcerer Aberrant Mind Spells]]). Each of these spells counts as a [[Sorcerer]] spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of [[Sorcerer]] spells you know.

Whenever you gain a [[Sorcerer]] level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a divination or an enchantment spell from the [[Sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], or [[Wizard]] spell list.
