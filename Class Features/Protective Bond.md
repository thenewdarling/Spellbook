Beginning at 6th level, the bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your [[Emboldening Bond]] feature is about to take damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.
