By 18th level, your ability to move creatures and objects with your mind is matched by few. You can cast the [[Telekinesis]] spell, requiring no components, and your spellcasting ability for the spell is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you concentrate on the spell, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a bonus action.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest]], unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to cast it again.
