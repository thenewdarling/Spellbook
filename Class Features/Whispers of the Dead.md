When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, echoes of those who have died cling to you. Whenever you finish a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]], you can gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you use this feature to choose a different proficiency that you lack.
