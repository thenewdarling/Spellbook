At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

-   You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.

-   If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.
