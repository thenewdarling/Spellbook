At 1st level, you learn one cantrip of your choice from the [[Druid]] spell list. You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival. This cantrip counts as a cleric cantrip for you, but it doesnâ€™t count against the number of cleric cantrips you know.
