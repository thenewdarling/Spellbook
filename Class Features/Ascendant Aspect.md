At 17th level, your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:

-   **Augment Breath.** When you use your [[Breath of the Dragon]], you can spend 1 [[ki]] point to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic energy becomes either a 60-foot cone or a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your [[Martial Arts]] die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

-   **Blindsight.** You gain blindsight out to 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re [[blinded]] or in [[darkness]]. Moreover, you can see an [[invisible]] creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

-   **Explosive Fury.** When you activate your [[Aspect of the Wyrm]], draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your aura. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your [[ki]] save DC or take 3d10 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice).
