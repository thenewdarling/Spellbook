Starting at 9th level, you can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:

-   Whenever a creature drinks an [[Experimental Elixir]] you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

-   You can cast [[Lesser Restoration]] without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
