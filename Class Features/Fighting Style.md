-   **Archery.** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

-   **Blind Fighting.** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're [[blinded]] or in darkness.

    -   You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your [[Maneuvers]].
