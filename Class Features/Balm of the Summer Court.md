At 2nd level, you become imbued with the blessings of the Summer Court. You are a font of energy that offers respite from injuries. You have a pool of fey energy represented by a number of d6s equal to your [[Druid]] level.

As a bonus action, you can choose an ally you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your [[Druid]] level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.
