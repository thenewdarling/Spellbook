Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being [[charmed]], and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your [[Warlock]] spell save DC or be [[charmed]] by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
