At 2nd level, if a creature has a [[Bardic Inspiration]] die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The [[Bardic Inspiration]] die is then lost.

*Note: Optional addition from [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
