At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cast the [[Etherealness]] spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
