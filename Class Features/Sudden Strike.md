Starting at 17th level, you can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a bonus action. This attack can benefit from your [[Sneak Attack]] even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your [[Sneak Attack]] against the same target more than once in a turn.
