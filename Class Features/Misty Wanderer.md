When you reach 15th level, you can slip in and out of the Feywild to move in a blink of an eye: you can cast [[Misty Step]] without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest]].

In addition, whenever you cast [[Misty Step]], you can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of you. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of your destination space.
