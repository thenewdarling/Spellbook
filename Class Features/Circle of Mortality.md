At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

In addition, you learn the [[Spare the Dying]] cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of [[Cleric]] cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.
