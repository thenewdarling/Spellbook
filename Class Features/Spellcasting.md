# Spellcasting

## Paladin

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See backlinks on [[Paladin]] for the spell list.

##### Preparing and Casting Spells

The [[Paladin]] table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your [[Paladin]] spells. To cast one of your [[Paladin]] spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[long rest]].

You prepare the list of [[Paladin]] spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the [[Paladin]] spell list. When you do so, choose a number of [[Paladin]] spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your [[Paladin]] level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level [[Paladin]], you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell [[Cure Wounds]]), you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a [[long rest]]. Preparing a new list of [[Paladin]] spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your [[Paladin]] spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a [[Paladin]] spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
