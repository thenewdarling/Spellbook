Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a [[Long Rest]], you gain the effect of a [[Sanctuary]] spell that lasts until the start of your next [[Long Rest]] (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.
