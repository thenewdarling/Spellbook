Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use your [[Ki]] to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you can spend 2 [[Ki]] points to cast [[Darkness]], [[Darkvision]], [[Pass without Trace]], or [[Silence]], without providing material components. Additionally, you gain the [[Minor Illusion]] cantrip if you don't already know it.
