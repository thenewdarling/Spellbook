At 9th level, you've learn new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your [[Steel Defender]] hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the strike to create one of the following effects:

-   The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.

-   Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.

You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest]].
