At 3rd level, your mystical touch can mend wounds. As an action, you can spend 1 [[Ki]] point to touch a creature and restore a number of hit points equal to a roll of your [[Martial Arts]] die + your Wisdom modifier.

When you use your [[Flurry of Blows]], you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a [[Ki]] point for the healing.
