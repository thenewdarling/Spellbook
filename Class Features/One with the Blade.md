At 6th level, you extend your [[Ki]] into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.

-   **_Magic Kensei Weapons._** Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

-   **_Deft Strike._** When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 [[Ki]] point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your [[Martial Arts]] die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.
