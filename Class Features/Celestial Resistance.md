Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]]. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.
