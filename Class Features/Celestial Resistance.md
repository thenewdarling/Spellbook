Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a [[short rest]] or [[long rest]]. These temporary hit points equal your [[Warlock]] level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your [[Warlock]] level + your Charisma modifier.
