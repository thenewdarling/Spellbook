Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:

-   Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet

-   An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered

-   Proficiency in Constitution saving throws

-   Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)

Each time you cast a [[School of Transmutation]] spell of 1st level or higher, you can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.

If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to function.
