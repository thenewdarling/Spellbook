At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your [[Pact Magic]] feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a [[long rest]] before you can do so again.
