When you reach 6th level, you learn to use your star map to divine the will of the cosmos. Whenever you finish a [[long rest]], you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next [[long rest]], you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

**Weal (even).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

**Woe (odd).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].
