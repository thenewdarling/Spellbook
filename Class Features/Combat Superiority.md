When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn [[Maneuvers]] that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.

**_[[Maneuvers]]._** You learn three [[Maneuvers]] of your choice. Many [[Maneuvers]] enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional [[Maneuvers]] of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new [[Maneuvers]], you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

**_Superiority Dice._** You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a [[short rest]] or [[long rest]]. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

**_Saving Throws._** Some of your [[Maneuvers]] require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Maneuver save DC** \= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
