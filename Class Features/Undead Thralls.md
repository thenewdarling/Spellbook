At 6th level, you add the [[Animate Dead]] spell to your spellbook if it is not there already. When you cast [[Animate Dead]], you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate.

Whenever you create an undead using a [[School of Necromancy]] spell, it has additional benefits:

-   The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level.

-   The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls.
