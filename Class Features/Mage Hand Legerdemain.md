Starting at 3rd level, when you cast [[Mage Hand]], you can make the spectral hand [[invisible]], and you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

-   You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or carried by another creature.

-   You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another creature.

-   You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at range.

You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.

In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your [[Cunning Action]] to control the hand.
