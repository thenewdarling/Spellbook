From 1st level, you have darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the [[Darkness]] spell, which doesn't count against your number of [[Sorcerer]] spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.
