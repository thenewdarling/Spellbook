At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an [[incapacitated]] humanoid. That creature is then [[charmed]] by you until a [[Remove Curse]] spell is cast on it, the [[charmed]] condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again.

You can communicate telepathically with the [[charmed]] creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
