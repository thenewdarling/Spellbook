Starting at 17th level, your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you to unleash its full potential. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 [[Ki]] points to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self and awaken it for 10 minutes. This awakening ends early if you are [[incapacitated]] or die.

While your astral self is awakened, you gain the following benefits.

**_Armor of the Spirit._** You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class.

**_Astral Barrage._** Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack three times if all the attacks are made with your astral arms.
