Starting at 17th level, your touch can channel the energy of death into a creature. As an action, you touch one creature within 5 feet of you, and you expend 1 to 10 [[Ki]] points. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, and it takes 2d10 necrotic damage per [[Ki]] point spent on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
