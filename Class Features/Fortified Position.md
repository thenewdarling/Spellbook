By 15th level, youâ€™re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using [[Eldritch Cannon]]:

-   You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with [[Eldritch Cannon]], as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.

-   You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.
