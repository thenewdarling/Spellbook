Beginning at 7th level, you can condense part of your swarm into a focused mass that lifts you up. As a bonus action, you gain a flying speed of 10 feet and can hover. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you are [[incapacitated]].

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest]].
