At 3rd level, you have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a [[long rest]] and consult those formulas in your spellbook, you can replace one [[Wizard]] cantrip you know with another cantrip from the [[Wizard]] spell list.

*Note: Optional addition from [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
