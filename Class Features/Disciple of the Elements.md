When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline requires you to spend [[Ki]] points each time you use it.

You know the [[Elemental Discipline#Elemental Attunement]] discipline and one other [[Elemental Discipline]] of your choice. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.

**_Casting Elemental Spells._** Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material components for it.

Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional [[Ki]] points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as [[Burning Hands]]) does. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional [[Ki]] point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level [[Monk]] and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast [[Burning Hands]], you can spend 3 [[Ki]] points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline's base cost of 2 [[Ki]] points plus 1).

The maximum number of [[Ki]] points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base [[Ki]] point cost and any additional [[Ki]] points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your [[Monk]] level, as shown in the Spells and [[Ki]] Points table.

Spells and [[Ki]] Points

[[Monk]] Levels				Maximum [[Ki]] Points for a Spell
5th-8th						3
9th-12th					4
13th-16th					5
17th-20th					6
