When you reach 5th level, you can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try and conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.

*Note: this is an optional class feature unlocked by [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
