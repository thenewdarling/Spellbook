At 10th level, the constellations of your [[Starry Form]] improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your [[Starry Form]], you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.
