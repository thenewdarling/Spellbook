At 7th level the bond you share with your [[Drake Companion]] intensifies, protecting you and stoking the drake’s fury. When you summon your drake, it grows wings on its back and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed.

In addition, while your drake is summoned, you and the drake gain the following benefits:

**Drake Mount.** The drake grows to Medium size. Reflecting your special bond, you can use the drake as a mount if your size is Medium or smaller. While you are riding your drake, it can’t use the flying speed of this feature.

**Magic Fang.** The drake’s Bite attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the type chosen for the drake’s Draconic Essence.

**Resistance.** You gain resistance to the damage type chosen for the drake’s Draconic Essence.
