By the 7th level, You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below.

_**Psi-Powered Leap.**_ As a bonus action, you can propel your body with your mind. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a [[short rest]] or [[long rest]], unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.

_**Telekinetic Thrust.**_ When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. If the save fails, you can knock the target [[prone]] or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.
