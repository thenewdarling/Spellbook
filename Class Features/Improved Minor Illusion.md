When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the [[Minor Illusion]] cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different [[Wizard]] cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast [[Minor Illusion]], you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.
