Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a [[Short Rest]]. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of the [[Short Rest]], each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.
