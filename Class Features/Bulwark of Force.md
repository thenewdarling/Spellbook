At 15th level, you can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a bonus action, you can choose creatures, which can include you, that you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures is protected by half cover for 1 minute or until you're [[incapacitated]].

Once you take this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a [[long rest]], unless you expend a Psionic Energy die to take it again.
