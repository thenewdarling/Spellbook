Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your [[Sorcerer]] level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your [[Sorcerer]] spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.
