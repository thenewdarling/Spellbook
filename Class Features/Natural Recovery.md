Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a [[Short Rest]], you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your [[Druid]] level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a [[Long Rest]].

For example, when you are a 4th-level [[Druid]], you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
