Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the [[Cleric]] class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a [[Sorcerer]] cantrip or a [[Sorcerer]] spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the [[Cleric]] spell list or the [[Sorcerer]] spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a [[Sorcerer]] spell for you.

In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a [[Sorcerer]] spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of [[Sorcerer]] spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the [[Cleric]] spell list.


Good - [[Cure Wounds]]
Evil - [[Inflict Wounds]]
Law - [[Bless]]
Chaos - [[Bane]]
Neutrality - [[Protection from Evil and Good]]
