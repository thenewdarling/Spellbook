This 3rd-level feature replaces the Primeval Awareness feature. You gain no benefit from the replaced feature and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it.

You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest]].

*Note: this is an optional feature from [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
*It replaces the [[Primeval Awareness]] feature.*
