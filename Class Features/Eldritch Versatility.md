Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:

-   Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from the [[Warlock]] spell list.

-   Replace the option you chose for the [[Warlock#Pact Boon]] feature with one of that feature's other options.

-   If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another [[Warlock]] spell of the same level.

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your [[Eldritch Invocations]], you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.

*Note: this is an optional rule from [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
