At 11th level, you can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a [[long rest]], you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a lst- or 2nd-level spell from the [[Artificer]] spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.
