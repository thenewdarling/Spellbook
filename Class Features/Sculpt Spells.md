Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your [[School of Evocation]] spells. When you cast a [[School of Evocation]] spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
