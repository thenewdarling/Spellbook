At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your [[Ki]]. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 [[Ki]] points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of [[Ki]] points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.
