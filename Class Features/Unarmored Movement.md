Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain [[Monk]] levels, as shown in the [[Monk]] table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.
