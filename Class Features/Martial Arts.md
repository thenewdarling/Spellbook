At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and [[Monk]] weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only [[Monk]] weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:

-   You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and [[Monk]] weapons.

-   You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or [[Monk]] weapon. This die changes as you gain [[Monk]] levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the [[Monk]] table.

-   When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a [[Monk]] weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the [[Monk]] weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a [[Monk]] weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon on the [[Weapons]] page.
