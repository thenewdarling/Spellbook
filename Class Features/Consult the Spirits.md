At 10th level, you gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the [[Augury]] or [[Clairvoyance]] spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of [[Clairvoyance]] invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

After you cast either spell in this way, you canâ€™t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
