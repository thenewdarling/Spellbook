Also at 3rd level, you learn the [[Mage Hand]] cantrip if you don't already know it. When you cast it, the hand takes the form of your swarming nature spirits.

You also learn an additional spell of 1st level or higher when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Swarmkeeper Spells table. Each spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

*see [[Ranger Swarmkeeper Spells]]*
3rd			[[Faerie Fire]], [[Mage Hand]]
5th			[[Web]]
9th			[[Gaseous Form]]
13th		[[Arcane Eye]]
17th		[[Insect Plague]]
