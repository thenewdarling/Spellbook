Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Gloom Stalker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

3rd		[[Disguise Self]]
5th		[[Rope Trick]]
9th		[[Fear]]
13th	[[Greater Invisibility]]
17th	[[Seeming]]
