Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid spell list.

*Note: this is an optional class feature unlocked by [[Tasha's Cauldron of Everything]]*
