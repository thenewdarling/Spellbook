Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

##### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the [[Warlock]] spell list. You learn additional [[Warlock]] cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the [[Warlock]] table.

##### Spell Slots

The [[Warlock]] table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your [[Warlock]] spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[short rest]] or [[long rest]].

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell [[Witch Bolt]], you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

##### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [[Warlock]] spell list.

The Spells Known column of the [[Warlock]] table shows when you learn more [[Warlock]] spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new [[Warlock]] spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the [[Warlock]] spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [[Warlock]] spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your [[Warlock]] spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a [[Warlock]] spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** \= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** \= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

##### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your [[Warlock]] spells.
