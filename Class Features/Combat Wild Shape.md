When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use [[Wild Shape]] on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by [[Wild Shape]], you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.
