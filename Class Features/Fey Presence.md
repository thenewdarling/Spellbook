Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all [[charmed]] or [[frightened]] by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]].
