Starting at 6th level, you can move in sudden, swaying ways. You gain the following benefits.

-   **Leap to Your Feet.** When you're [[prone]], you can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

-   **Redirect Attack.** When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can spend 1 [[Ki]] point as a reaction to cause that attack to hit one creature of your choice, other than the attacker, that you can see within 5 feet of you.
