At 17th level, you gain the ability to make an overwhelming number of attacks against a group of enemies. When you use your [[Flurry of Blows]], you can make up to three additional attacks with it (up to a total of five [[Flurry of Blows]] attacks), provided that each [[Flurry of Blows]] attack targets a different creature this turn.
