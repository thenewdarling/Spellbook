At 10th level, you add the [[Polymorph]] spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. You can cast [[Polymorph]] without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.

Once you cast [[Polymorph]] in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]], though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.
