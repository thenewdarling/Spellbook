Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of [[Ki]] in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 [[Ki]] point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of your next turn.
