At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a [[Long Rest]], you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next [[Long Rest]] or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it’s armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it’s a weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [[Long Rest]].
