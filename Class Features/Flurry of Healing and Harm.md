Starting at 11th level, you can now mete out a flurry of comfort and hurt. When you use [[Flurry of Blows]], you can now replace each of the unarmed strikes with a use of your Hands of Healing, without spending [[Ki]] points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an unarmed strike with [[Flurry of Blows]], you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the [[Ki]] point for Hands of Harm. You can still use Hands of Harm only once per turn.
