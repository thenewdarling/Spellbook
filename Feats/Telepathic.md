You awaken the ability to mentally connect with others, granting you the following benefits:

-   Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

-   You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

-   You can cast the [[Detect Thoughts]] spell, requiring no spell slot or components, and you must finish a [[long rest]] before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat. If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.
