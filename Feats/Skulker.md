_Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher_

You are an expert at slinking through shadows. You gain the following benefits:

-   You can try to hide when you are lightly obscured from the creature from which you are hiding.

-   When you are hidden from a creature and miss it with a ranged weapon attack, making the attack doesn't reveal your position.

-   Dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight.
