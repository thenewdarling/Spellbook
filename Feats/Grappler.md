_Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher_

You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:

-   You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.

-   You can use your action to try to pin a creature [[grappled]] by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both [[restrained]] until the grapple ends.
