_Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell_

You have learned techniques to enhance your attacks with certain kinds of spells, gaining the following benefits:

-   When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.

-   Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.

-   You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from the [[Bard]], [[Cleric]], druid, [[Sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], or [[Wizard]] spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you chose from: Charisma for [[Bard]], [[Sorcerer]], and [[Warlock]]; Wisdom for [[Cleric]] or druid; or Intelligence for [[Wizard]].
