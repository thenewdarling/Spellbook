_Prerequisite: [[Spellcasting]] or [[Pact Magic]] feature_

Studying occult lore, you have unlocked eldritch power within yourself: you learn one [[Eldritch Invocations]] option of your choice from the [[Warlock]] class. If the invocation has a prerequisite, you can choose that invocation only if youâ€™re a [[Warlock]] and only if you meet the prerequisite.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the invocation with another one from the [[Warlock]] class.
