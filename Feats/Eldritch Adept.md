_Prerequisite: [[Spellcasting]] or [[Pact Magic]] feature_

Studying occult lore, you learn one [[Eldritch Invocation]] option of your choice from the [[warlock]] class. Your spellcasting ability for the invocation is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat). If the invocation has a prerequisite, you can choose that invocation only if youâ€™re a [[Warlock]] and only if you meet the prerequisite.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the invocation with another one from the [[Warlock]] class.
