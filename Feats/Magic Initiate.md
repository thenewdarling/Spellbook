Choose a class: [[Bard]], [[Cleric]], [[Druid]], [[Sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], or [[Wizard]]. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class's spell list. In addition, choose one 1st-level spell to learn from that same list. Using this feat, you can cast the spell once at its lowest level, and you must finish a [[long rest]] before you can cast it in this way again.

Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the class you chose: Charisma for [[Bard]], [[Sorcerer]], or [[Warlock]]; Wisdom for [[Cleric]] or [[Druid]]; or Intelligence for [[Wizard]].
