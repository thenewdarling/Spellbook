_Prerequisite: The ability to cast at least one spell_

-   When you gain this feat, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

-   Spells you cast ignore resistance to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of that type, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

-   You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.
