You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

-   Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

-   Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.

-   Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
