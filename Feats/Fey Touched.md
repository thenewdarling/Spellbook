Your exposure to the Feywild's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:

-   Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

-   You learn the [[Misty Step]] spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the [[School of Divination]] or [[School of Enchantment]]. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a [[long rest]]. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
