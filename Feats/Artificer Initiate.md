You’ve learned some of an [[Artificer]]’s inventiveness:

-   You learn one cantrip of your choice from the [[Artificer]] spell list, and you learn one 1st-level spell of your choice from that list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

-   You can cast this feat's 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a [[long rest]] before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

-   You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice, and you can use that type of tool as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability.
