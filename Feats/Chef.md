Time and effort spent mastering the culinary arts has paid off. You gain the following benefits:

-   Increase your Constitution or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

-   You gain proficiency with cook’s utensils if you don’t already have it.

-   As part of a [[short rest]], you can cook special food, provided you have ingredients and cook's utensils on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for a number of creatures equal to 4 + your proficiency bonus. At the end of the [[short rest]], any creature who eats the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points regains an extra 1d8 hit points.

-   With one hour of work or when you finish a [[long rest]], you can cook a number of treats equal to your proficiency bonus. These special treats last 8 hours after being made. A creature can use a bonus action to eat one of those treats to gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
