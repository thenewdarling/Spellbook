You can prepare and deliver deadly poisons, gaining the following benefits:

-   When you make a damage roll, you ignore resistance to poison damage.

-   You can coat a weapon in poison as a bonus action, instead of an action.

-   You gain proficiency with the poisoner's kit if you don't already have it. With one hour of work using a poisoner's kit and expending 50 gp worth of materials, you can create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and become [[poisoned]] until the end of your next turn.
