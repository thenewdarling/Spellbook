Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

-   You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.

-   Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.

-   When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding.
