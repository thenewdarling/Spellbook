_**In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common [[Races]], late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder [[Races]], and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.**_

### Keldon (Dominaria)

Source: [[Plane Shift - Dominaria]]

The people of Keld are human, but they are like no other humans anywhere. Nearly all adults stand over six feet tall, and heights above seven feet are not uncommon. They are massively muscled and have gray skin, ranging from an ashy gray-white to a deeper bluegray. The typical Keldon’s hairline points sharply down in the middle of the forehead and at either temple, but recedes elsewhere—sometimes dramatically. Keldons are remarkably resistant to the cold of their homeland, baring skin even in near-freezing temperatures without discomfort.

Keldons value self-reliance, strength, and courage above all else. Anything that is the product of their own labor is a fine thing. Anything else is treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. At best, they are a proud, pragmatic, passionate people, and their loyalty is fierce once earned. At worst, they can be reckless, hot-tempered, and violent—and no small number of Keldons still consider these qualities virtues rather than vices.

The humans of Keld have the following traits, which replace the standard human traits presented in the _Player’s Handbook_.

-   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.

-   **Age.** Keldons reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

-   **Alignment.** Keldons tend toward chaotic alignments, and many walk a fine line between good and evil.

-   **Size.** Keldons are taller and heavier than the human norms of other cultures, standing almost universally above 6 feet tall and reaching heights above 7 feet. Your size is Medium.

-   **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

-   **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Keldon.

-   **Natural Athlete.** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.

-   **Keldon Resilience.** You have proficiency in Strength saving throws.

-   **Icehaven Born.** You are naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the _Dungeon Master’s Guide_.

### Human (Innistrad)

Source: [[Plane Shift - Innistrad]]

Innistrad’s population is mostly human, and player characters in an Innistrad campaign should be human in most circumstances. However, the humans of Kessig are different in many respects from those of Gavony, and Nephalia’s urban culture is very distinct from the shadow-draped land of Stensia. Diversity among player characters comes not from race, but from each character’s home province.

Human characters on Innistrad have the following traits. If you use these human traits, do not use the variant human traits presented in the _Player’s Handbook_. As well, in campaigns that use feats, characters should not be allowed to choose feats that duplicate any provincial traits

-   **Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

-   **Alignment.** Humans tend toward no particular alignment.

-   **Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

-   **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

-   **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

-   **Provincial Origin.** Choose one of the four provinces of Innistrad as the place of origin for your character.
    -   Gavony
        -   Whether safe behind the walls of the High City of Thraben or out in the moors with little more than shuttered windows, barred doors, and grim determination to stand against the horrors of the night, the humans of Gavony are the most well-rounded people of Innistrad.
        -   **Ability Score Increase.** Your ability scores each increase by 1.
    -   Kessig
        -   For the Kessiger, life is work. Kessigers are farmers, millers, weavers, and stonemasons, living close to the land and working hard for every meal. This makes them self-reliant, pragmatic, and plainspoken.
        -   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores each increase by 1.
        -   **Forest Folk.** You have proficiency in the Survival skill.
        -   **Fleet of Foot.** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.
        -   **Sure-Footed.** When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement on that turn.
        -   **Spring Attack.** When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of your turn, whether you hit or not.
    -   Nephalia
        -   Beneath an ever-present shroud of fog billowing in from the sea, the people of Nephalia maintain a semblance of normalcy, buying and selling goods from across Innistrad in their bustling markets, setting out to sea in tiny fishing boats, or tilling the soggy earth in waterlogged fields.
        -   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence and Charisma scores each increase by 1.
        -   **Breadth of Knowledge.** You gain proficiency in any combination of four skills or with four tools of your choice.
    -   Stensia
        -   Countless generations of hardship and proximity to the vampire strongholds—leading to lost children and neighbors—have taught Stensians to guard their hearts. They are proud and fervent in their beliefs but seem brusque or even cold to the people of other provinces.
        -   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 1.
        -   **Daunting.** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.
        -   **Tough.** Your hit point maximum increases by 2, and it increases by 2 every time you gain a level.
