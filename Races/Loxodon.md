_**Loxodons are often oasis of calm in Ravnica. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. As they say, "There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man."**_

You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options. It can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.

-   **Keen Smell.** Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve smell.

-   **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Loxodon.
