_**Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbones.**_

## Merfolk Features (Ixalan)

The River Heralds are merfolk—a race of amphibious humanoids at home throughout the oceans, rivers, and rain forests of Ixalan. They stand between seven and eight feet tall, with skin that ranges from deep burgundy through many shades of violet and blue, to green, bright orange, and yellow. They are humanlike in shape, but have long fins extending from their shoulders, forearms, middle backs, and calves. Frills of fins also protrude from the backs of their heads. All merfolk can breathe air or filter oxygen from the water, and they can walk on land or swim with equal ease.

        -   Green merfolk generally have yellow chests and pale green faces, shading to dark blues and purples on their backs and limbs. The patterns on their skin suggest the colors of the tree frogs common in the rain forest, as do their eyes of orange, lime green, or sky blue. Their fins are relatively short and thick.

## Merfolk Features (Zendikar)

Curious, thoughtful, and analytical, the merfolk of Zendikar are natural scholars and explorers. In the past, merfolk society was organized around their belief in three deities. But in the wake of the reappearance of the Eldrazi, the merfolk have realized that their faith was a web of lies, built on a corrupted memory of the Eldrazi titans handed down from generation to generation. In peaceful times, the merfolk might have fought over the ultimate meaning of this revelation. But faced with the danger presented by the Eldrazi broods, the merfolk have largely set aside their differences and joined together in a united force. Old grudges still linger, but the well-being of the merfolk race—and the world—far outweigh any ancient conflicts between creeds.

Merfolk are associated with knowledge, logic, and strategy, though the traditional merfolk creeds express this connection in different ways.

-   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

-   **Age.** Merfolk mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live considerably longer than humans, though, often reaching well over 100 years.

-   **Alignment.** Most merfolk are neutral, though merfolk of the Emeria and Cosi creeds have chaotic leanings.

-   **Size.** Merfolk are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

-   **Amphibious.** You can breathe air and water.

-   **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common, Merfolk and one additional language of your choice.

-   **Creeds.** The merfolk race is divided into three creeds, founded on the principles of Emeria (wind), Ula (water), and Cosi (the trickster). A merfolk isn’t born into a creed but chooses it upon reaching adulthood, and it is rare for a merfolk not to choose a creed. Merfolk of the wind and water creeds aren’t hostile to each other, but members of each creed regard the other creed with a vague disdain. Members of both those creeds regard the Cosi creed with suspicion and some degree of fear, and Cosi-creed adherents tend to keep their affiliation secret. Choose one of these creeds for your character.
    -   Emeria (Wind) Creed
        -   Merfolk who followed Emeria’s creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring the mystical forces—rather than natural causes—behind historical events. They are evasive and intentionally enigmatic in their interactions with others, and are often described as manipulative and deceptive.

        -   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.
        -   **Water Creed Navigation.** You have proficiency with navigator’s tools and in the Survival skill.

        -   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by an additional 1 (for a total of 2), and your Intelligence score increases by 1.
        -   **Creed of the Trickster.** You have proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and Stealth skills.
