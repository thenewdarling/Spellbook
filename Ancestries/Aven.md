**_Aven have humanlike bodies, arms, and legs, along with birdlike wings and heads. Two distinct varieties of aven are found in Naktamun. One has the head of a hawk or similar bird of prey, with short wings allowing fast flight. The other variety has the head of an ibis atop a long neck, with wide, angular wings better suited to soaring. All aven have lean bodies with feathers extending from their heads down to their shoulders._**

-   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

-   **Age.** Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can theoretically live into their 80s. Of course, most find a glorious (or inglorious) death long before that point.

-   **Alignment.** Most aven lean toward some form of neutrality. Ibis-headed aven, focused more on knowledge than any other virtue, are usually neutral. Hawk-headed aven are inclined toward lawful neutral.

-   **Size.** Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

-   **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can’t use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can’t use your flying speed if you are encumbered.)

-   **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Aven.

### Ibis-Headed Aven

A majority of ibis-headed aven, drawn to the teachings of Kefnet, specialize in spellcasting. They take great pride in all the qualities they share with the god of knowledge—not just their avian heads, but their quick wit, self-confidence, cunning, and spellcasting prowess.

-   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

-   **Kefnet's Blessing.** You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any Intelligence check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.

### Hawk-Headed Aven

Following the example of Oketra, hawkheaded aven often focus on the techniques of long-range combat. Most prefer javelins, but some are skilled with bows, spears, and throwing axes.

-   **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 2.

-   **Hawkeyed.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill. In addition, attacking at long range doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
