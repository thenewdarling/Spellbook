# To-do
- Add channel divinities, class features, racial traits.
- Confirm updated to most recent errata.
- Update tags to be links (in non-destructive way) - plan is to have subclass tags link to sections within the main class note. So long as I can still see backlinks for subsections
- Find links that have been broken by changing the file names from hyphens to spaces
- Update "Classes" notes with actual information, eg. the level-up table and a link to Channel Divinity for Cleric
- Test out Windows version with my precious Notepad++ lol
