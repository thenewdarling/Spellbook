# How to Use
This is designed as a searchable database of DnD 5e knowledge. Using Obsidian's backlinks system, everything should be referenceable by everything else.

If you are syncing with GitHub, note the database has been told to ignore the contents of the folder "Z", so store any of your personal notes such as character sheets and session notes in that folder. A basic character sheet template has also been supplied alongside this readme.

# To-do
- Classes
	- Barbarian
	- Fighter
	- Ranger
- Add racial traits.
- To confirm updated to most recent errata.
- Fill in stubs on Magic Items list from the ones added via [[Artificer Infusions]]
- Update remaining class tags (and any others I am missing)

# Errata
The contents have been checked to be up to date with:

- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, v2.1 (2020)
- Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (2020)
- Xanathar's Guide to Everything v1.0 (2020)
	- Barb features to be confirmed after adding:


Path of the Ancestral Guardian (p. 9). In the Path of the An- cestral Guardian Features table, all three instances of “d8” are now “d6”.

# Credits

Spellbook contains open-source components:
- Main bulk of spell list was taken from the contents of https://github.com/thebombzen/grimoire/. 
	- Any changes so far have been to confirm errata, introduce cross-linking between spells wherever I have found, change format of tags, and add missing tags where appropriate.
