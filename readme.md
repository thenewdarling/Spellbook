Uses spell stats from https://github.com/thebombzen/grimoire/

# How to Use
This is designed as a searchable database of DnD 5e knowledge. Using Obsidian's backlinks system, everything should be referenceable by everything else.

If you are syncing with GitHub, note the database has been told to ignore the contents of the folder "Z", so store any of your personal notes such as character sheets and session notes in that folder. A basic character sheet template has also been supplied alongside this readme.

# To-do
- Add channel divinities.
- Add class features.
- Add racial traits.
- To confirm updated to most recent errata.
- Update tags to be links (in non-destructive way) 
	- Plan is to have subclass tags link to sections within the main class note. So long as I can still see backlinks for subsections
- Update "Classes" notes with actual information, eg. the level-up table and a link to Channel Divinity for Cleric
- Arcane Tradition Class Feature is empty for Wizards, should look like Divine Domain as part of the Cleric's really.
- Put images of the level up tables now you know you can do that.

# Errata
This spell database has been checked to be up to date with:

- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, v2.1 (2020)
