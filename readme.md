# How to Use
This is designed as a searchable database of DnD 5e knowledge. Using Obsidian's backlinks system, everything should be referenceable by everything else.

If you are syncing with GitHub, note the database has been told to ignore the contents of the folder "Z", so store any of your personal notes such as character sheets and session notes in that folder. A basic character sheet template has also been supplied alongside this readme.


# Errata
The contents have been checked to be up to date with:

- Player's Handbook v3.0 (2021)
- Dungeon Master's Guide v3.0 (2021)
- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, v2.1 (2020)
- Xanathar's Guide to Everything v1.0 (2020)
- Volo's Guide to Monsters v3.0 (2021)
- Tasha's Cauldron of Everything v1.0 (2021)
- Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft (2021) (subclasses, ancestry options)
- Fizban's Treasury of Dragons (2021) (subclasses, feats and spells)

# Missing Information
I put more emphasis on accuracy than availability. Hence, I try to make sure if something is in here, it's updated to the latest available errata. There are entire sections of information missing, most of which is information I simply can't be bothered tracking. Feel free to make a pull request if you add more magic items, the Tasha's Battle Master [[Maneuvers]], etc.

Spellbook contains open-source components:
- Main bulk of spell list was taken from the contents of https://github.com/thebombzen/grimoire/. 
	- Any changes so far have been to confirm errata, introduce cross-linking between spells wherever I have found, change format of tags, and add missing tags where appropriate.
