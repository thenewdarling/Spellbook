# To-do
- Add channel divinities.
- Add class features.
- Add racial traits.
- To confirm updated to most recent errata.
- Update tags to be links (in non-destructive way) 
	- Plan is to have subclass tags link to sections within the main class note. So long as I can still see backlinks for subsections
- Update "Classes" notes with actual information, eg. the level-up table and a link to Channel Divinity for Cleric
