# How to Use
This is designed as a searchable database of DnD 5e knowledge. Using Obsidian's backlinks system, everything should be referenceable by everything else.

If you are syncing with GitHub, note the database has been told to ignore the contents of the folder "Z", so store any of your personal notes such as character sheets and session notes in that folder. A basic character sheet template has also been supplied alongside this readme.


# Errata
The contents have been checked to be up to date with:

- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, v2.1 (2020)
- Xanathar's Guide to Everything v1.0 (2020)
- Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (2020)
- Fizban's Treasury of Dragons (2021) (feats and spells)

# Credits

Spellbook contains open-source components:
- Main bulk of spell list was taken from the contents of https://github.com/thebombzen/grimoire/. 
	- Any changes so far have been to confirm errata, introduce cross-linking between spells wherever I have found, change format of tags, and add missing tags where appropriate.
