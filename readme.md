# How to Use
This is designed as a searchable database of DnD 5e knowledge. Using Obsidian's backlinks system, everything should be referenceable by everything else.

If you are syncing with GitHub, note the database has been told to ignore the contents of the folder "Z", so store any of your personal notes such as character sheets and session notes in that folder. A basic character sheet template has also been supplied alongside this readme.

# To-do
- Classes
	- Artificer
	- Barbarian
	- Druid
	- Fighter
	- Monk
	- Ranger
	- Rogue
	- Warlock list of invocations should be inside [[Eldritch Invocations]]
- Add racial traits.
- To confirm updated to most recent errata.
- Update remaining class tags (and any others I am missing)

# Errata
The contents have been checked to be up to date with:

- Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, v2.1 (2020)

# Credits

Spellbook contains open-source components:
- Main bulk of spell list was taken from the contents of https://github.com/thebombzen/grimoire/. 
	- Any changes so far have been to confirm errata, update tags for this system, and introduce cross-linking between spells wherever I have found. However any future changes to that system will likely not be reflected here.
