# To-do
- Add channel divinities.
- Add class features.
- Add racial traits.
- To confirm updated to most recent errata.
- Update tags to be links (in non-destructive way) 
	- Plan is to have subclass tags link to sections within the main class note. So long as I can still see backlinks for subsections
- Find links that have been broken by changing the file names from hyphens to spaces
	- In fact all built-in links look a bit dodgy, I'm wondering if I can find a way to weed them out.
- Update "Classes" notes with actual information, eg. the level-up table and a link to Channel Divinity for Cleric
