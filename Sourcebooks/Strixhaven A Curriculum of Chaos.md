The School of Magic is in Session

**Rollicking campus adventures for the world’s greatest roleplaying game.**

The greatest minds in the multiverse meet at Strixhaven University. Professors convey fantastic secrets to eager students, and life on campus is frenetic. But danger lurks even here. Campus hijinks mix with mishaps and sinister plots, and it’s up to you to save the day.

_Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos_ introduces the fantastical setting of Strixhaven University, drawn from the multiverse of _Magic: The Gathering_, and provides rules for creating characters who are students in one of its five colleges. Characters can explore the setting over the course of four adventures, which can be played together or on their own. Each adventure describes an academic year filled with scholarly pursuits, campus shenanigans, exciting friendships, hidden dangers, and perhaps even romance.
