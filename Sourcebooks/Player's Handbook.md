# Player's Handbook

The Player's Handbook, released in 2014, is one of the three core rulebooks for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition. It is the primary rulebook which describes how to play Dungeons & Dragons, and is considered necessary for play. Unlike the other two core rulebooks, which are mainly reserved for use by the Dungeon Master, the Player's Handbook is intended for use by all players of the game.

Player's Handbook is commonly abbreviated to PH or PHB. The officially supported abbreviation PH is more technically correct, as "handbook" is one word, but usage of PHB is common in the D&D community.
