 

Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering are two different games, but that doesn’t mean their multi- verses can’t meet.

From the beginning, Magic’s plane of Zendikar was conceived as an “adventure world” where par- ties of explorers delve into ancient ruins in search of wonders and treasures, fighting the monsters they en\- counter on the way. Many of the plane’s creative roots lie in D&D, so it should be no surprise that The Art  
of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar feels a lot like a D&D campaign setting book. It’s littered with adven- ture hooks and story seeds, and lacks only the specific rules references you’d need to adapt Zendikar’s [[Races]], monsters, and adventures to a tabletop D&D cam- paign. And it’s all surrounded by amazing fantasy art that holds boundless inspiration in itself.

You can think of Plane Shift: Zendikar as a sort of supplement to The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Ze- ndikar, designed to help you take the world detail and story seeds contained in that book and turn them into an exciting D&D campaign. The easiest way to ap\- proach a D&D campaign set on Zendikar is to use the rules that D&D provides mostly as written: A druid on Zendikar might call on green mana and cast spells like giant growth, but she’s still just a druid in the D&D rules (perhaps casting giant insect).

Plane Shift: Zendikar was made using the fifth edition of the D&D rules that you can find here. D&D is a flexible rules system designed to model any kind of fantasy world. The D&D magic system doesn’t involve five colors of mana or a ramping-up to your most powerful spells, but the goal isn’t to mirror  
the experience of playing Magic in your roleplaying game. The point is to experience the worlds of Magic in a new way, through the lens of the D&D rules. All you really need is [[Races]] for the characters, monsters for them to face, and some ideas to build a campaign.

Finally, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zen- dikar will help you create a D&D campaign in Zend\- ikar, but you don’t actually need the book to make use of this material—you can also refer to the abundance of lore about Zendikar found on magicthegathering. com.
