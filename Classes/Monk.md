# Monastic Tradition
When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

# Way of the Astral Self
*A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their [[Ki]] as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.*

3rd level -- [[Arms of the Astral Self]]
6th level -- [[Visage of the Astral Self]]
11th level -- [[Body of the Astral Self]]
17th level -- [[Awakened Astral Self]]

# Way of the Drunken Master
*The Way of the Drunken Master teaches its students to move with the jerky, unpredictable movements of a drunkard. A drunken master sways, tottering on unsteady feet, to present what seems like an incompetent combatant who proves frustrating to engage. The drunken masterâ€™s erratic stumbles conceal a carefully executed dance of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats.*

*A drunken master often enjoys playing the fool to bring gladness to the despondent or to demonstrate humility to the arrogant, but when battle is joined, the drunken master can be a maddening, masterful foe.*

3rd level -- [[Bonus Proficiency#Monk Drunken Master]], [[Drunken Technique]]
6th level -- [[Tipsy Sway]]
11th level -- [[Drunkard's Luck]]
17th level -- [[Intoxicated Frenzy]]

# Way of the Four Elements
*You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements. When you focus your [[Ki]], you can align yourself with the forces of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.*

*Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of their [[Ki]] powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.*

3rd level -- [[Disciple of the Elements]] 
(and again at 6th, 11th, 17th)



# Way of the Kensei
*Monks of the Way of Kensei train relentlessly with their weapons, to the point that the weapon becomes like an extension of the body. Founded on a mastery of sword fighting, the tradition has expanded to include many different weapons.*

*A kensei sees a weapon much in the same way a calligrapher or a painter regards a pen or brush. Whatever the weapon, the kensei views it as a tool used to express the beauty and precision of the martial arts. That such mastery makes a kensei a peerless warrior is but a side effect of intense devotion, practice, and study.*

3rd level -- [[Path of the Kensei]]
6th level -- [[One with the Blade]]
11th level -- [[Sharpen the Blade]]

# Way of the Long Death
*Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying. They capture creatures and prepare elaborate experiments to capture, record, and understand the moments of their demise. They then use this knowledge to guide their understanding of martial arts, yielding a deadly fighting style.*

3rd level -- [[Touch of Death#Monk Way of the Long Death]]
6th level -- [[Hour of Reaping]]
11th level -- [[Mastery of Death]]

# Way of Mercy
*Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt. However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as an act of mercy.*

*Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be members of a religious order, administering to the needy and making grim choices rooted in reality rather than idealism. Some might be gentle-voiced healers, beloved by their communities, while others might be masked bringers of macabre mercies.*

*The walkers of this way usually don robes with deep cowls, and they often conceal their faces with masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bringers of life and death.*

6th level -- [[Hands of Harm]], [[Physician's Touch]]

# Way of the Open Hand
*Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate [[Ki]] to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.*

6th level -- [[Wholeness of Body]]
11th level -- [[Tranquility]]
17th level -- [[Quivering Palm]]


# Way of Shadow
*Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their students.*
