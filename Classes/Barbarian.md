### Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

## Path of the Ancestral Guardian
*Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.*

*Barbarians who draw on their ancestral guardians can better fight to protect their tribes and their allies. In order to cement ties to their ancestral guardians, barbarians who follow this path cover themselves in elaborate tattoos that celebrate their ancestors’ deeds. These tattoos tell sagas of victories against terrible monsters and other fearsome rivals.*

3rd level - [[Ancestral Protectors]]
6th level - [[Spirit Shield]]
10th level - [[Consult the Spirits]]
14th level - [[Vengeful Ancestors]]

## Path of the Battlerager
*Known as Kuldjargh (literally "axe idiot") in Dwarvish, battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.*

### Restriction: Dwarves Only

Only dwarves can follow the Path of the Battlerager. The battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarven society and culture.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction exists for the Forgotten Realms. It might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.

3rd level - [[Battlerager Armor]]
6th level - [[Reckless Abandon]]
10th level - [[Battlerager Charge]]
14th level - [[Spiked Retribution]]

## Path of the Beast
*Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.*

*Such a barbarian might be inhabited by a primal spirit or be descended from shape-shifters. You can choose the origin of your feral might or determine it by rolling on the Origin of the Beast table.*

3rd level - [[Form of the Beast]]
6th level - [[Bestial Soul]]
10th level - [[Infectious Fury]]
14th level - [[Call the Hunt]]

## Path of the Berserker
*For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end – that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.*

3rd level - [[Frenzy]]
6th level - [[Mindless Rage]]
10th level - [[Intimidating Presence]]
14th level - [[Retaliation]]

## Path of the Storm Herald
*Typical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.*

*Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect the natural realm. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges founded in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.*
*source: [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]]*

3rd level - [[Storm Aura]]
6th level - [[Storm Soul]]
10th level - [[Shielding Storm]]
14th level - [[Raging Storm]]

## Path of the Totem Warrior
*The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.*

*Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.*

3rd level - [[Spirit Seeker]], [[Totem Spirit]]
6th level - [[Aspect of the Beast]]
10th level -  [[Spirit Walker]]
14th level - [[Totemic Attunement]]


## Path of Wild Magic
*Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.*

3rd level - [[Magic Awareness]], [[Wild Surge]]
6th level - [[Bolstering Magic]]
10th level - [[Unstable Backlash]]
14th level - [[Controlled Surge]]

## Path of the Zealot
*Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots – warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.*

*A variety of gods across the worlds of D&D inspire their followers to embrace this path. Tempus from the Forgotten Realms and Hextor and Erythnul of Greyhawk are all prime examples. In general, the gods who inspire zealots are deities of combat, destruction, and violence. Not all are evil, but few are good.*
