# Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd Level, you choose an Arcane Tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools, such as Evocation. Your choice grants you features at 2nd Level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.


## Abjuration
*The [[School of Abjuration]] emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.*

*Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.*

2nd level - [[Abjuration Savant]], [[Arcane Ward]]
6th level - [[Projected Ward]]
10th level -[[Improved Abjuration]]
14th level - [[Spell Resistance]]


## Bladesinger
*Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.*

*In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.*

## Chronurgy
*Focusing on the manipulation of time, those who follow the Chronurgy tradition learn to alter the pace of reality to their liking. Using the ramping of anticipatory dunamis energy, these mages can bend the flow of time as adroitly as a skilled musician plays an instrument, lending themselves and their allies an advantage in the blink of an eye.*

## Conjuration
*As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.*

6th level - [[Benign Transportation]]
10th level - [[Focused Conjuration]]
14th level - [[Durable Summons]]


## Divination
*The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.*

10th level - [[The Third Eye]]
14th level - [[Greater Portent]]


## Enchantment
*As a member of the [[School of Enchantment]], you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.*

2nd level - [[Enchantment Savant]], [[Hypnotic Gaze]]
6th level - [[Instinctive Charm]]
10th level - [[Split Enchantment]]
14th level - [[Alter Memories]]


## Evocation
*You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.*

2nd level - [[Evocation Savant]], [[Sculpt Spells]]
6th level - [[Potent Cantrip]]
10th level - [[Empowered Evocation]]

## Graviturgy
*Understanding and mastering the forces that draw bodies of matter together or drive them apart, the students of the Graviturgy arcane tradition learn to further bend and manipulate the violent energy of gravity to their benefit, and the terrible detriment of their enemies.*

2nd level - [[Adjust Density]]
6th level - [[Gravity Well]]
10th level - [[Violent Attraction]], Improved [[Adjust Density]]
14th level - [[Event Horizon]]


## Illusion
*You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists – including many gnome wizards – are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.*

6th level - [[Malleable Illusions]]
10th level - [[Illusory Self]]

## Necromancy
*The [[School of Necromancy]] explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.*

*Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.*

2nd level - [[Necromancy Savant]], [[Grim Harvest]]
6th level - [[Undead Thralls]]
10th level - [[Inured to Undeath]]
14th level - [[Command Undead]]


## Order of Scribes
*Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wizardry. The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.*

*Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!*

2nd level - [[Wizardly Quill]], [[Awakened Spellbook]]
6th level - [[Manifest Mind]]
10th level - [[Master Scrivener]]

## Transmutation
*You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.*

*Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.*

2nd level - [[Transmutation Savant]], [[Minor Alchemy]]
6th level - [[Transmuter's Stone]]
10th level - [[Shapechanger]]
14th level - [[Master Transmuter]]


## War Magic
*A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster’s spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.*

*Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents’ attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them.*

*In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage's typical response: "What good is being able to throw a mighty Fireball if I die before I can cast it?"*
