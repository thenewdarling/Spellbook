# Roguish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

# Arcane Trickster
*Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.*

3rd level -- [[Spellcasting#Rogue Arcane Trickster]], [[Mage Hand Legerdemain]]
9th level -- [[Magical Ambush]]
13th level -- [[Versatile Trickster]]
17th level -- [[Spell Thief]]

# Assassin
*You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.*

3rd level -- [[Bonus Proficiency#Rogue Assassin]], [[Assassinate]]
9th level -- [[Infiltration Expertise]]
13th level -- [[Impostor]]
17th level -- [[Death Strike]]


# Inquisitive
*As an archetypal Inquisitive, you excel at rooting out secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your sharp eye make you well equipped to expose and end hidden evils.*

3rd level -- [[Ear for Deceit]], [[Eye for Detail]], [[Insightful Fighting]]
9th level -- [[Steady Eye]]
13th level -- [[Unerring Eye]]
17th level -- [[Eye for Weakness]]

# Mastermind
*Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.*
*source: [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]]*

3rd level -- [[Master of Intrigue]], [[Master of Tactics]]
9th level -- [[Insightful Manipulator]]
13th level -- [[Misdirection]]
17th level -- [[Soul of Deceit]]

# Phantom
*Many rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues discover a mystical connection to death itself. These rogues take knowledge from the dead and become immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers and spies.*

*Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters of these macabre techniques, and some are willing to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgotten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can become a wizard's confidant and right hand. In temples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as an agent to track down those who try to cheat death and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be lost to the grave.*

*How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities? Or did you cultivate them in a temple or thieves' guild dedicated to a deity of death?*

3rd level -- [[Whispers of the Dead]], [[Wails from the Grave]]
9th level -- [[Tokens of the Departed]]
13th level -- [[Ghost Walk]]
17th level -- [[Death Knell]]


# Scout
*You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter â€“ these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.*
*source: [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]]*

3rd level -- [[Skirmisher]], [[Survivalist]]
9th level -- [[Superior Mobility]]
13th level -- [[Ambush Master]]
17th level -- [[Sudden Strike]]

# Soulknife
*Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of thieves' guilds, though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.*

*Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk the path of the Soulknife, serving as silent, lethal guardians of their woods. In the endless war among the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a Soulknife when stealth is required against the githyanki foe.*

*As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since you were a child, only revealing their full potential as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.*

3rd level -- [[Psionic Power]], [[Psychic Blades#Rogue Soulknife]]
9th level -- [[Soul Blades]]
13th level -- [[Psychic Veil]]
17th level -- [[Rend Mind]]

# Swashbuckler
*You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Duelists and pirates typically belong to this archetype.*

*A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.*
*source: [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]]*

3rd level -- [[Fancy Footwork]], [[Rakish Audacity]]
9th level -- [[Panache]]
13th level -- [[Elegant Maneuver]]
17th level -- [[Master Duelist]]

# Thief
*You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.*
