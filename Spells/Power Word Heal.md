*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: Touch

*Components*: V, S

*Duration*: Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, [[frightened]], paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
