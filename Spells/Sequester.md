**7th-level transmutation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: Touch

*Components*: V, S, M (a powder of diamond, emerald, rube and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

*Duration*: Until dispelled

By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target, it becomes [[invisible]] and can’t be targeted by [[School of Divination]] spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by [[School of Divination]] spells.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.  Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
