**4th-level evocation**

*Casting time*: 1 bonus action

*Range*: Self

*Components*: V

*Duration*: [[Requires concentration]], up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell’s duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can’t take reactions, until the end of its next turn.
