**2nd-level transmutation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 60 feet

*Components*: V, S

*Duration*: Instantaneous

Choose an area of flame that you can see and that can fit within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

**Fireworks.** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [[blinded]] until the end of your next turn.

**Smoke.** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.
