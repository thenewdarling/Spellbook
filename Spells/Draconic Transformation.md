**7th-level transmutation**

*Casting time*: 1 bonus action

*Range*: Self

*Components*: V, S, M (a statuette of a dragon, worth at least 500 gp)  

*Duration*: [[Requires concentration]], up to 1 minute

With a roar, you draw on the magic of dragons to transform yourself, taking on draconic features. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

**Blindsight.** You have blindsight with a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re [[blinded]] or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [[invisible]] creature, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

**Breath Weapon.** When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns for the duration, you can exhale shimmering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Wings.** Incorporeal wings sprout from your back, giving you a flying speed of 60 feet.
