**2nd-level transmutation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 150 feet

*Components*: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)

*Duration*: [[Requires concentration]], up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. 

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that canâ€™t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
