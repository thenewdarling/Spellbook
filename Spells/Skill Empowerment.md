**5th-level transmutation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: Touch

*Components*: V, S

*Duration*: [[Requires concentration]], up to 1 hour

Your magic deepens a creature’s understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill.

You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn’t already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus.
