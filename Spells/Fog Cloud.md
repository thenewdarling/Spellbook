**1st-level conjuration**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 120 feet

*Components*: V, S

*Duration*: [[Requires concentration]], up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
