**4th-level evocation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 150 feet

*Components*: V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)

*Duration*: Instantaneous

You point at a place within range, and a glowing 1-foot diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and another 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.
