**8th-level evocation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 150 feet

*Components*: V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)

*Duration*: Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is [[blinded]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t [[blinded]] by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature [[blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[blinded]].

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
