**Conjuration cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Until cast again

You flick your wrist with a flourish, causing a single object that weighs no more than five pounds that you hold within your hand to vanish. The object is actually transported and stored within a small extradimensional pocket plane. The object remains there indefinitely until this cantrip is cast again, upon which it is immediately transported back into your grasp. You cannot store an object while one already occupies the extradimensional pocket.
