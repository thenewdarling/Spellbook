**4th-level conjuration**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 90 feet

*Components*: V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)

*Duration*: [[Requires concentration]], up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be [[restrained]] by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already [[restrained]] by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature [[restrained]] by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
