**2nd-level illusion (ritual)**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 120 feet

*Components*: V, S

*Duration*: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it.
