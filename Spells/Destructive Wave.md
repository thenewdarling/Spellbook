**5th-level evocation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: Self (30-foot radius)

*Components*: V

*Duration*: Instantaneous

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [[prone]]. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked [[prone]].
