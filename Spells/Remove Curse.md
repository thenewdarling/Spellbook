**3rd-level abjuration**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: Touch

*Components*: V, S

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magical item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its ownerâ€™s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
