**2nd-level illusion**

*Casting time*: 1 action

A creature you touch becomes [[invisible]] until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is [[invisible]] as long as it is on the targetâ€™s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
