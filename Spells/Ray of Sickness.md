**1st-level necromancy**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: 60 feet

*Components*: V, S

*Duration*: Instantaneous

A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also [[poisoned]] until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
