**2nd-level evocation**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: Self (30-foot cone)

*Components*: S, M (a vial of meltwater)

*Duration*: Instantaneous


A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t hindered by ice.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
