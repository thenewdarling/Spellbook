**Evocation cantrip**

*Casting time*: 1 action

*Range*: Self (5 foot radius) 5 feet

*Components*: V, M (a weapon)

*Duration*: Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make  
a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting abil\- ity modifier.

This spell’s damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature in\- creases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).
