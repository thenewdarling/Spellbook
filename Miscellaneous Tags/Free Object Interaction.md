**Official Notes on Free Actions 5e**

**Other Activity On Your Turn (PHB pg 190)**

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride towards a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

**Editor's Summary of Above**
1) Some element of communication is free throughout.
2) You can **also** do **one** action for 'free' which is ruled as not enough to require a full action, move or bonus action (eg. open a door, draw a weapon).
3) A **second** 'free' action will require using your action.

___
**Speculation -- JCraw unofficial content**
Common ruling is that sheathing a weapon counts as a 'free action' as point 2, but dropping a weapon on the ground is similar to rules on speech in point 1, requiring no effort.

Therefore, you can drop and draw a weapon in one turn, and then attack as normal. If you sheath your weapon and then draw another, it uses your action as point 3.
