You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 Charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren't Hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, Ending the Effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the Effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended Charges daily at dawn.
