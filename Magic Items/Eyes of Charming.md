Requires [[Attunement]]

These Crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 Charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the Charm Person spell (save DC 13) on a Humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended Charges daily at dawn.
