Requires [[Attunement]]

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [[Detect Thoughts]] spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain [[Concentration]] on the spell, you can use a Bonus Action to send a Telepathic Message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply — using a Bonus Action to do so — while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [[Detect Thoughts]], you can use an action to cast the [[Suggestion]] spell (save DC 13) from The Helm on that creature. Once used, the Suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
